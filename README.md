# Ethics-Fairytale
This is a lord of the rings based fairytale, and the goal is to attempt to teach a wizard to use AI responsibly. The images are a mix of real Deviant art user's art, and AI generated images, and the project also includes AI generated text at appropriate times. There are mulitple endings, and multiple paths determined on previous choices.
